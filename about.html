                  My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
                </h2>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                  I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought
                  that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any
                  of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                  Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
                  didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
                </p>
                <h3 class="sub-heading">How I turned things around</h3>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                  I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                  everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the
                  garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and
                  I quit my job.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                  It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a
                  bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                </p>
                <h3 class="sub-heading">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                  Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                  I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more
                  free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                  With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no
                  choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can
                  benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
                  started this site!
